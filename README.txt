## Overview

This repository contains code that implements a genetic algorithm to solve the machine loading problem. The problem involves optimizing the allocation of resources to different tasks in order to minimize system imbalance, reduce losses, and maximize resource utilization.

The genetic algorithm is implemented in MATLAB R2014a and is designed to find optimal solutions to the machine loading problem. The algorithm takes into account various parameters such as crossover and mutation rates, number of generations, and population size.

## Features

- Mathematical model of the machine loading problem
- Parental selection method in the genetic algorithm
- Configuration of genetic algorithm parameters
- Evaluation of solutions' fitness based on system imbalance
- Optimized solutions leading to improved system performance and efficiency
- Utilization of Microsoft Excel for data storage and MATLAB for algorithm implementation

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the MATLAB R2014a environment.
3. Load the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet containing the original data (It is enough to place the required spreadsheet in the Current Folder in MATLAB and change the name of the spreadsheet in the MATLAB script to the name of the required spreadsheet.).
4. Run the MATLAB script "machine_load.m" implementing the genetic algorithm.
5. Analyze the results generated by the algorithm.
